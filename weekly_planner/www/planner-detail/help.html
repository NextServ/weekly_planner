<h5>How do I create a lesson entry</h5>
<ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
    <li class="list-group-item">Click Add Students. On the pop-up, you can choose the list of students you want to see by defining it in the Filter by Student Group field. This drop-down menu will show you the levels you have access to.
    <li class="list-group-item">Once selected, click Show Students. It will show you all the students in that level. Select the students you want to be included in the week plan by clicking on their names. Click again to unselect.
    <li class="list-group-item">Then click Add Selected.
    <li class="list-group-item">To add presentations, click Add Topics.
    <li class="list-group-item">You may search the presentations you want to add. Click on the presentation name to select. Click Add Selected once you've selected all the presentations you need. If you missed to add some, you can click Add Topics again.
    <li class="list-group-item">Before you can submit your week plan, you have to define the status of each presentation for each student. To do that, click on the row of the presentation name in the column of the student name. Then select the status of the presentation as well as the date. Then hit Save.
    <li class="list-group-item">When you're ready to submit, click Submit Planner.
</ol><br />

<h5>I want to start again. How do I delete a week plan?</h5>
<ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
    <li class="list-group-item">On your Weekly Planner dashboard, click Edit on the row of the week plan you want to delete.
    <li class="list-group-item">Click Del Planner.
    <li class="list-group-item">Click Delete.
</ol><br />

<h5>The presentation I need is not on the list.</h5>
Contact your HOS so he/she can add it to the list. Don't worry, we will have an update for this soon that will enable you to independently add your own presentations.<br /><br />

<h5>I can't submit my week plan.</h5>
Make sure that you have filled out all the prerequisites. Missing one of the prerequisites below will display an error when you attempt to submit your week plan:
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Week
    <li class="list-group-item">Students
    <li class="list-group-item">Topics (a.k.a. presentations)
    <li class="list-group-item">Status of presentation
</ul><br />

<h5>I can't find the Submit Planner button.</h5>
You will need to open the particular week plan you want to submit. If you've already opened the week plan and it still doesn't show, that means it has already been submitted. Click Back and check the Status of your week plan to verify.<br /><br />

<h5>I made a mistake but I've already submitted my week plan.</h5>
You may still edit your week plan regardless if it's been submitted or in draft. Make sure to save it.<br /><br />

<h5>I want to create another week plan similar/identical to one that already exists.</h5>
Open the week plan you want to duplicate, then click Duplicate Planner. You will need to reselect the student group, students, and the week. Duplicating a week plan only copies the presentations, which means you will no longer need to add topics. Tick Include lesson entries if you want to copy the presentation status as well. You will still be able to add topics to the week plan as necessary.
